    - When running as a server, Factorio can be told to listen for RCON connections.
      To use this, specify both the --rcon-port and --rcon-password parameters on the command line. The network protocol is specified here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol
    - New parameter to start the headless server: --start-server-load-latest. Instead of accepting a save name, it will automatically load the latest save in the saves folder.
    - The "disallow-commands" flag has been changed to "allow-commands" and accepts "true", "false", and "admins-only" for values.
    - It is stored and shown which player built each of the machines.
    - Added cluster grenades and grenade upgrades.

  Ease of use:
    - Turret displays its range when you hover over it.
    - Rail signal/train stop placement indicator. (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-134)
    - Indicator of train vehicle positions in a station when building next to track where would the train stop.
    - It is possible to change the module in the slot to different one without having to clear it first.
    - It is possible to upgrade modules to more powerful variant in machine by fast entity transfer.
    - Clear cursor first cancels the current action (rail building, wire dragging, blueprint/deconstruction), and only removes the item from the cursor when pressed again.
    - Saving a game changes selected name and directory for next saves. (https://forums.factorio.com/19461)
    - Clicking different filtered slot in quickbar will try to clear the currently selected quickbar item if possible.
    - Cleaning item in cursor that is taken from quickbar slot will try to refill the slot from the inventory if possible.
    - Clicking on the warning icon will open the location on the map.

    - Fixed the zoom to cursor feature introduced in 0.8 that was non functional since 0.10.
    - Improved the rail selection logic in junctions.
    - Stone Rock can now be mined and deconstructed by robots. It gives some stone as resource.
    - Combinators input and output arrows in alt mode. Additional alt mode information can be turned on in the options menu.
    - The constant combinator has an on/off switch.
    - Several non-stackable items can be swapped directly with counterparts (power armor, deconstruction planner, selection tools).
    - Inventory filter slots can be copy-pasted from empty slots onto empty slots using the stack transfer/split controls (shift + left click, shift + right click by default).
  Balancing:
    - The productivity module pollution addition was lowered (30%->5%, 40%->7.5%, 50%->10%), as the pollution generated by the machine is already increased
      by the additional energy production and time, it doesn't need to be so high as the modules are quite expensive already.
    - Repair packs have double durability (100->200) and stack size (50->100).
    - Changed stack size of raw wood (50->100) so it doesn't fill the inventory so quickly.
    - Roboport have decreased transmition power consumption (200kw->50kw) while the robots (and their recharging) has increased power consumption (200kW per recharge slot to 1Mw per slot)
      Basically, covering area by roboports is cheaper, but using robots for transport is more expensive. To keep the personal roboport usefulness, energies used in personal roboport have been
      all multiplied by 10.
    - Inserters are able to squeeze things "slightly" better to belts. more resources.
    - Increased size of several green science and few blue science technologies.
    - Increased inventory size of cargo wagon. (30->40)
    - Oil yield drains to 10% two times slower.
    - Big and behemoth enemies spawn 50% slower.
    - Armor resistances are applied before the energy shield is used.
    - Increased the ghost time to live when something is destroyed from 5 + 5 minutes to 30 + 30 minutes.
    - Halved the mining time of rails, rail signals and walls.
    - Changed the way evolution factor approaches the maximum (1).
      The addition of evolution factor was changed from addition * (1 - evolution) to addition * (1 - evolution)^2
      This means that the progress gets more slower towards the high values.
    - Balanced train acceleration and top speed, additional wagons no longer slow trains so strongly.
    - Changed the amount of items requested when copy-pasting assembling machines to requester chests for several recipes.
    - Express underground belts require lubricant to match the express belts and express splitters.
    - Increased battery equipment power storage, input, and output by a factor of 20.
  Changes:
    - Reduced number of connections drawn between roboports in blueprint and roboports on map.
    - More virtual signals for combinators.
    - Vitual signals can be used in blueprint icons.
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.10.0 version (You can use 0.10.12 to load older saves and re-save them).

    - Ghosts created by player no longer expire and can be placed before researching any technologies.
    - Ghosts are brighter and easier to see.
    - Alert of destroyed entity exists 2 times longer.
    - Quickbar filters are set and unset using the same key.
    - Loading a scenario without control.lua will automatically load the freeplay game mode scripts.
      This means new maps created in the map editor will get the freeplay game mode.
    - Loading a scenario in the map editor will preserve it's scripts.
      This means custom freeplay/sandbox maps can be created in-game.
    - Constant combinator can be rotated.
    - All types of inserters can be controlled by the circuit and logistic network, once the respective network is researched.
    - All types of chests can be connected to the circuit network. Smart Chest was removed from the game.
    - Decider combinator "input count" option makes the combinator copy the count of the specified output signal from the input signals,
      instead of copying the count from the condition. This might break some setups. https://forums.factorio.com/13706
    - Transport belt connectable entities will disconnect from incoming (and all other) belts when marked for deconstruction.
      The problem is solves is described in this bug report: https://forums.factorio.com/19038

Version: 0.12.11
Date: 16. 10. 2015
  Features:
    - Added --no-auto-pause: When running as a server, --no-auto-pause will prevent stopping the game when no players are connected.
  Optimisations:
    - Optimised the particle performance. Helps during heavy fights.
  Changes:
    - Showing the log file location when the game crashes, so it is eaiser to find when reporting the bug.
    - The "graphics.force-opengl" option default value is true when AMD graphics card is present.
  Bugfixes:

    - Fixed that remove_item didn't remove from player ammo, gun, tool and armor slots. (https://forums.factorio.com/16960)
  Scripting:
    - Changed LuaSurface::set_multi_command signature. Now the function takes a table with following keys:
      command(required), unit_count(required), force(optional), unit_search_distance(optional)
      This solves issue with not finding any enemies to attack: https://forums.factorio.com/16541
    - Removed game.on_save function. There should be no need for it and it was causing too many problems.
    - Lua on_load function is not called when saving the game anymore. It is called only on actual load now.
    - Lua API calls on_load, on_init, on_configuration_changed, on_event and generate_event_name
      have been moved to a new namespace called script (so from now use script.on_load(...)). This will break many mods!
      The callback registered in on_load function doesn't have access to the game API. This is to avoid common desyncs.
      The on_init and on_configuration_changed still retain the access to the game API.
    - on_configuration_changed is fired when the map version changes, a mod version changes, a mod is added, or a mod is removed and passes "data":
      Pushes old_version="x.x.x", new_version="x.x.x" when loading map versions other than the current version
      When a mod version is changed it appears as a table of mod changes: {["Mod name"] = {old_version="x.x.x", new_version="x.x.x"}, ...}
      When a mod is added it appears as: ["Mod name"] = {old_version=nil, new_version="x.x.x"}
      When a mod is removed it appears as: ["Mod name"] = {old_version="x.x.x", new_version=nil}
    - Changed LuaGameScript::makefile to LuaGameScript::write_file and added an optional third parameter bool to append.
  Modding:
    - Replaced entity type "rail" with types "straight-rail" and "curved-rail". Property "bending_type" is optional for rail entities,
      but is still mandatory for rail remnants.

      and returns a new rail (or nil) following that specification from the given rail entity.
    - LuaTrain::front_rail, LuaTrain::back_rail, LuaTrain::rail_direction_from_front_rail and LuaTrain::rail_direction_from_back_rail

      Position of the created entity does not matter.
    - Added LuaItemStack::set_blueprint_tiles/get_blueprint_tiles - the counterpart to get/set_blueprint_entities.
    - LuaEntity::insert/remove_item and LuaInventory::insert/remove now return counts of inserted/removed items.

    - Default mods are always enabled if mod-list.json is lost (even when enable new mods option is disabled).
    - LuaSurface can be invalid when read from LuaPlayer and Player entity if the player is disconnected from the game (MP disconnect) - use LuaSurface.valid to check.
      Note: LuaSurface currently never switches between valid and not valid so the check only has to be done when it's first read from the LuaPlayer.
    - Changed default maximum range of projectiles from 10^308 to 1000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.12.0
Date: 17. 07. 2015
  Features:
    - The game is now finished by launching the rocket with satellite.
    - Added chain signals, they can be used to make more complicated junctions and stations without deadlocks.
    - Added personal roboport as modular armor equipment.
      Once it is active, it uses the materials and robots in the players inventory.
      It supports all the tasks construction robots can do like building blueprints, repairing structures, deconstruction etc.
    - Added logistic trash fields to the character gui.
      They supply items into the logistic system in the same way active provider chests do.
    - Added combinators (Arithmetic Combinator, Decider Combinator and Constant combinator).
      These allow more advanced manipulation with the circuit network logic (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-88)
    - The Lamp, Storage Tank, Small Pump and Offshore Pump can be connected to the circuit network.
    - Multiplayer latency hiding (gives impression that some common tasks are performed immediately)
      Applies to character movement, mining buildings, building, fast replacing, opening guis, etc.
    - Stone brick can be used to build stone path. (30% walking speed increase).
    - Concrete can be created.
      The concrete can be used to build concrete floors (40% walking speed increase).
    - Terrain modifies vehicle friction force (sand: 1.8, grass: 1.6, dirt: 1.4, stone path: 1.1, concrete: 0.8).
    - Trees degenerate slowly when there high pollution levels.
    - Lab research is now continuous. Science packs have progress bars of usage.
      This means that 20 labs doing research with 10 units will still be faster than 10
      labs and the science packs aren't wasted.
    - Assembling machine input slot can contain more than the usual stack size when the recipe requirement demands it (3 X recipe demand).
      Example: The rocket silo requires 1000 steel, while the stack size is 100, but the input stack can hold enough.
    - Added / updated sounds for biters, spitters, worm, spawner, flamethrower, tank, lasers, etc.
    - New ambient soundtrack added.
      Added mechanism that prevents playing track that was played recently.
      The ambient player alternates between neutral wind/environment sounds and soundtrack songs.
    - Mousing over a train will show you its current path and blocks it can't enter.
    - Locomotives now show the contents of attached cargo wagons in their tooltip.
    - Trees regenerate health slowly.
    - Added support for transferring contents/settings when fast-replacing all entity types.
    - Added modules to the alt-view for entities that support modules.
    - Factorio can run as a dedicated server without graphics (http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Multiplayer#Headless_server).
    - Basic PvP: New forces can now be created and merged back together; a cease-fire can be agreed upon between forces
    - IPv6 support for multiplayer.
    - DNS names can be used when connecting to multiplayer game.
    - Enabled mining trees/ghosts while holding blueprints to be built.
    - Added explosive cannon shells.
    - Building blueprints over existing ghosts restores the ghost time to live to full.
  Changes:
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.9.0 version (You can use 0.9.8 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - Removed rocket defense entity.
    - Items on transport belts don't go off the belt at the end, so the transport belt has
      to go directly in front of the required inserter.
    - Reduced number of rendered Roboport connections.
    - The trade in the marketplace only happens if the player can accept the trade items.
    - Inserters can now extract from Roboports and Beacons.
    - Inserters now take items from right behind them, not from the center of the pickup target entity.
    - Copy entity settings mechanism now remembers only the last entity copied from.
      Also mechanism allows copy/paste across different entities of the same type (i.e. assembling machine 1 -> assembling machine 2) and
      from assembling machines to requester chests (sets filters to 2 x requirements of the assembling machine).
    - Trees have generally smaller bounding boxes, so it is easier to walk through forest.
    - Power armor modules generate and consume 100 times more power in order to be able to charge construction robots.
    - The construction robots don't build gate in the gap between the rolling stock vehicles. They wait for the train to get away.
    - Player's logistic filters are now remembered after respawn in multiplayer
    - All turrets are now 4x4; laser turrets are 4x more expensive and powerful, gun turrets are 2x more expensive
    - Roboport tooltip now shows correct numbers of contruction and logistic robots separately.
    - When a train loses a path and cannot find a new one, it stops immediately. This prevents it from riding into parts of the rail network, from where it can't find a path.
    - Improvements to circuit network wire connection. You can connect multiple wires of the same color to the same entity.
    - The autosave dialog no longer cancels an active blueprint or deconstruction planner selection if the mouse button is still held after the autosave finishes
    - Number of autosave slots is now configurable through config.ini (no GUI).
  Optimisations:
    - Overall optimisation of train + belt heavy factories is roughly 66% compared to 0.11,
      this means that the game runs 3 times faster.
    - Optimised the transport belt movement.
    - Optimised the rotated bounding box collisions checks (trains).
    - Optimised the smoke update.
    - Optimised the solar panel, all the solar panel input is merged, so the count doesn't matter.
    - Optimised the accumulators by merging then into groups, where typical factory has 1 group per network.
    - Optimised the land mine activation mechanism.
    - Smaller multiplayer heartbeat packet size.
    - Optimised adding/removing of roboport, robots keep their tasks if they can.
    - Path finder will terminate when search is too long. This avoids save explosions (see https://forums.factorio.com/12580).
    - Optimised rendering for large logistic networks.
    - Fixed that the graphics were saved twice in the RAM memory.
  Graphics:
    - New graphics of the combat robots.
    - New graphics of the laser/gun turrets, their color is now player/force dependent.
    - New graphics of muzzle flash for player, car, tank and turrets.
    - New tree graphics. Trees have 4 levels of leafes and the leafs are colorable.
    - Trees emit leaves (based on the tree color) when being mined and destroyed.
    - Trees emit branches when mined or destroyed.
    - Storage tank has a small window showing the liquid inside.
    - Combat robots attack beam (https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-84)
    - New GUI icons: Weapons, ammo, status icons such as out-of-ammo or out-of-electricity
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong item count in the logistic system when handling partially-filled magazines, repair packs or other items with durability
    - Fixed the choppy (not smooth) movement when using the exoskeleton equipment.
    - item-description localization now displays correctly when previewing recipes.
    - entity-description localization now displays on entities.
    - Proper blueprint centering. It is based on the included entities rather then the selection rectangle when the blueprint is created.
    - Very big entities no longer disappear at the edge of the screen
    - When putting things on ground, the first item was never put exactly under the cursor even when the place was empty.
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to swap stacks of the same items with different health.
    - Fixed strange behavior of tank/car entering sound.
    - Fixed LuaFluidBox crashing the game when attempting to read fluid from an entity that previously had fluidboxes.
    - Car / Tank ammo inventory is refilled from the trunk / player inventory when exhausted.

    - Fixed marking a ton of entities for deconstruction outside the construction range of roboports slowing down normal deconstruction rates.
    - Fixed crash when removing electric poles from electric networks or circuit networks with large amounts of poles (https://forums.factorio.com/13368).
    - Fixed video-memory-usage option on Windows. It is possible to run Factorio on configurations with low VRAM (less then 512MB). Other platforms don't have this issue.
    - Fixed that control-clicking entire inventory into a machine installed modules.
    - Fixed another instance of the "Trying to make chunk at unreasonable position" bug (https://forums.factorio.com/13399).
    - Requester chests no longer request more than they can store. E.g. if a requester chest only has one free slot and the requester slider is set to request 20000 iron ore, the chest will only request one stack from the network (https://forums.factorio.com/4604)

      when ammo stack was moved to gun slots from inventory when the previous slot was depleted.
    - Fixed that transport belts were still animating and emitting sounds even when they were stopped and prepared
      for deconstruction.
    - Fixed that construction robots, when deconstructing splitters/belts to ground didn't remove the items on these

    - The car can now accepts fuel and ammo into the trunk by inserter or shift/control click even when the
      burner/ammo slots are already full, so it goes to the trunk.
  Scripting:
    - Renamed the accelerationpereenergymodifier of lua car to effectivity_modifier.

    - Fixed that the game removed all the gui created by mod automatically on game load.
      Now it removes just gui of mods that were removed as before.
    - Fixed that rail over gate (or the other way around), wasn't buildable as part of the blueprint, as the first one
      built removed the ghost of the second one.
    - Fixed that the exe file in the zip package was missing the factorio icon.
    - Fixed that the menu in map editor was not responsible after clicking exit and cancel.

  Scripting:
    - Fixed that LuaEntity::get_item_count returned 6 times more for ammo turrets.
    - Removed write access to LuaGame::tick.
    - Disabled deactivating of rolling stock.
    - Lua debug library no longer return paths containing instalation directory.
  Modding:
    - Fixed that the data-updates.lua of base mod would overwrite the created effect of mod entities by the

  Changes:
    - Rail signal that is not dividing two rail blocks is changing colors the same way, as when it is connected to no rail

    - Fixed that ghosts of turrets were not removed when turret was built over.
    - Attempted to fix the "receiveMovementImpulse ended up with unreasonable position" car and tank error.
    - Unified the Floating point model on all windows distributions. That might solve the 32bit/64bit desync issues.
    - Fixed bug with double-clicking in assembler gui during autosaving (https://forums.factorio.com/6515).

    - Fixed train description speed units and locale.
  Changes:
    - In multiplayer game anyone can unpause the game (not just the one who paused it).
    - Walls and gates are fast replacable.
    - In Multiplayer, research progress gui (in the top right) blinks once research has completed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.11.1
Date: 31.10. 2014
  Bugfixes:
     - Removed test code leftover that artifically created desync every 20 seconds.
     - Fixed the localisation errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.11.0
Date: 31.10. 2014
  Features:
    - First version of the multiplayer.
      Only co-op mode. Simplistic UI. Requires a public IP address for connecting to.
      Tested mostly on LAN. Replays of MP games don't work yet. Number of players is not limited.
    - Added gates, they open when friendly player comes by. Gates built on straight rails become rail gates.
    - Added a tank. It is way more durable than a car. It has its own set of weapons.
    - Added spitters. They are a next evoluton step of biters with a ranged (spitting) attack.
      They are spawned in their own spawners (different mask color) but only after evolution reaches 0.3.
    - The console works as a chat tool by default now.
      Ingame commands can be used, /w for whisper or /c for lua command (previous functionality). For more type /help.
    - Highlight of the items added into the inventory (https://forums.factorio.com/3189)
    - Randomized lights turning on and off during dawn and dusk (https://forums.factorio.com/3493)
    - Item entities are now de-constructable.
    - Added a cancel deconstruction option to the deconstruction planner.
    - Copy/paste entitysettings (filters) for cargowagons (like e.g. recipes for assembling machines).
  Bugfixes:
    - Loads of determinism fixes, mainly for the multiplayer, but the replay stability should improve a lot as well.
    - When game speed is < 1 the gui doesn't lag.
    - Fixed crash when trying to connect trains in a situation that would result in collision of the new train with other trains
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5853).
    - Fixed invalid directions in game.create_entity() crashing the game.
    - Calling game.take_screenshot{} no longer crashes the game.
    - Fixed that some entities weren't placable in the map editor (worm corpses).
    - Fixed incorrectly disabled New game -> Custom scenario -> Confirm button.
    - Fixed that turret could be walked over when rebuilt until the game was reloaded.
    - Accidental building is now not possible when viewing the map.
    - Compatibility fix of the new OS X Yosemite.
    - Syntax error in script locale is now shown ingame, without closing the program.
    - Fixed crash when placing blueprints with wires over existing ghosts with wires (https://forums.factorio.com/5966)
    - Fixed the rail segment bug, when mod adds two same rails at the same position.
  Graphics:
    - New player animation. Three levels depending on the armor. All with masks.
    - Rail endings.
    - Biters/Spitters/Spawners/Worms are now drawn using the same picture with differently colored masks.
      This allows making different color combinations of biters without rising the video memory requirements.(Mods!)
    - Blood splashes when units die are now procedural.
  Balancing:
    - Stone walls need research (just red science packs needed).
    - Slower crafting (0.5s->10s) of solar panels and accumulators.
    - Fast/Express splitter are made from the lower variants (same as with transport belts/underground belts)
    - Small electric pole can be used as fuel.
    - Changed wood fuel value from (0.6MJ->2MJ), so 2Xwood made from raw wood has the same fuel value as the original raw wood.
  Optimisations:
    - Faster map drawing.
    - Optimized main loop. The game will automatically skip rendering when it can't keep up with expected updates per second.
      LowFPS mode has been removed because this functionality fully replaces it (it automatically lowers FPS when needed).
    - Added Bitmap Memory Caching. This allows to store certain sprites classes (defined by priority) in RAM and load them only when needed.
      If your computer has little VRAM try setting "Bitmap Caching Level" (in GraphicsSettings) to "very low".
      This will keep the trains / player and enemies dying animations in RAM, saving a lot of VRAM.
  Changes:
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.7.0 version (You can use 0.7.5 to load older saves and re-save them).
    - New physics for cars. Car now does very little damage when colliding.
    - Disabled shooting from a vehicle (capsules can still be thrown).
  Modding:
    - Added phases to the mod loading. data.lua of all mods is loaded first, then the data-updates.lua and the data-final-fixes.lua as last.
      This allows mods to change the data of other mods without the need to be last. This is used even in the base game, to add the
      dust effect when a building is created, so the effect is added to mod buildings as well.
    - Every animation / sprite can now have a color tint.
    - Every animation / sprite can have any number of "overlays" (see how player masks work).
    - Changed the frame_width/frame_height properties of animation to width/height so it is the same as in sprite.
    - Better specification for enemy spawner units (see biter-spawner for example).
    - Furnace and assembling machine have been internally united. They the the same animation and quite a few properties
     (crafting_categories, energy_usage, crafting_speed, animation, working_visualisations).
      As a result Furnace can now have fluid boxes and use recipes with multiple outputs (but not multiple inputs).
    - Extended car prototypes to make tanks possible.
    - Electric turret uses ammo_type directly from its attack_parameters.
    - Attack parameters accept warmup field which defines the delay before the effects take place (but animation and sound start playing instantly).
      This is now used for spitter shooting animation only.
  Scripting:
    - Lua API for writing / reading player color (i.e. game.player.color = {r=0.7, g=0.4, b=0.3})
    - Fixed saving and loading references to LuaEntity and LuaItem prototypes.
    - Fixed crash when calling game.set_tiles() with invalid parameters.
    - Added New LuaFluidBox object to interact with liquids.
    - Lua API for reading backer names of entities (and writing station-names).
    - Expansion of get_circuit_condition-method; the returned table contains a new key "fulfilled" which
      indicates if condition is met.
    - Expansion of get/set/clear-filter methods to allow access to cargowagon filters
    - Changed onplayercrafted; it is now called for every item in the crafting queue crafted
    - Added new events:
      on_robot_built_entity: passes entity built
      on_robot_pre_mined: identical to on_preplayer_mined_item but called by robots
      on_robot_mined: identical to on_player_mined_item
      on_research_started: passes the research name
      on_research_finished: passes the research finished
      on_player_rotated_entity: passes the entity rotated
      on_marked_for_deconstruction: passes the entity
      on_canceled_deconstruction: passes the entity
      on_trigger_created_entity: passes the entity created; only called if the trigger creating the entity has been marked with "trigger_created_entity = true"
      on_train_changed_state: passes the train
    - Added show_entity_info parameter to take_screenshot.
    - Function gettext was removed completely, localised strings are now specified by the curly-brackets {"key", {"key-parameter"}, "literal parameter", 7}
    - Added disconnect_neighbour: used with electric poles; takes the circuit connector to disconnect - none to disconnect standard copper wire.
    - Added ghost-related methods:
      ghost_name read: the ghost entity name
      ghost_localised_name read: the localised ghost entity name
      ghost_type read: the ghost entity type
      ghost_prototype read: the ghost entity prototype
      time_to_live read/write: the number of ticks until the ghost dies
    - Expanded direction and recipe to provide write access
    - Expanded methods to support reading/writing from ghost entities: (connect_neighbour, disconnect_neighbour, direction, get_circuit_condition, set_circuit_condition,
      clear_circuit_condition, orientation, rotateable, recipe, backer_name)
    - Changed set_circuit_condition parameters to: {circuit = index, operator = operator, name = name, count = count}
    - Added Lua API for reading/writing information from special items (ammo, armor, blueprints, tools)
    - Added Lua API for reading/writing armor equipment and equipment grids
    - Expanded methods for trains:
      locomotives read: returns the locomotives for the train
      state read: returns the current train state (train states are defined in defines.trainstate)
    - Lua objects can now be passed between scripts with remote.call().
      If an invalid object is passed the destination interface recives nil in place of the object.
    - Added game.players[] - returns a table of the current players
    - Expanded player-related methods to pass "player_index" of the player doing the action. If there is no player (map editor) the "player_index" value will be nil.
      (on_picked_up_item, on_built_entity, on_player_mined_item, on_preplayer_mined_item, on_player_createditem, onplayerrotatedetity)
    - Added "player_index" read to LuaGuiElement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.10.12
Date: 16.9. 2014
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to set a filter.
    - Fixed that fast replacing moved items primary to character, it made upgrading chests and machines not practical.
      Instead, when fast replacing, the content is always transferred to the new entity, when it can't fit, it transfers
      to player, and if it can't be moved to the player as well it makes the good old item bomb.
    - The right ui container is slightly larger, so it can contain the roboport info without enlarging.
    - The worm turrets are not taken into consideration when deciding enemy expansions.
    - Fixed that enemy expansion candidates were not updated correctly when base was destroyed.
    - Fixed that combat robots were on the map/minimap.
    - Fixed extra mousebuttons over gui behavior (https://forums.factorio.com/5810).
  Balancing:
    - The maximum distance for enemy expansion was increased from 5 to 7.
  Scripting:

    - Fixed that slightly more robots than needed could be send to empty provider chest (https://forums.factorio.com/5613).
    - When unresearching (using script) the toolbelt, the items that can't fit it are inserted back into the player's inventory.

    - Fixed that the container's inventory didn't get sorted in case the container couldn't be mined because all the items wouldn't fit the inventory.
      (https://forums.factorio.com/5614).
    - Fixed crash during enemy attack when the enemy unit was modded to attack by destroying everything including itself. (https://forums.factorio.com/5727)
    - Fixed that the player mined item event was not called when he got just part of the inventory (https://forums.factorio.com/5608).
    - Fixed that it wasn't possible to start fullscreen game in other than the primary window. There is now settings in config in category [graphics] section:
      preffered-screen-index. Changing the value changes the display adapter (monitor) that is used. If many people use this feature in the future, we can put it in the
      graphics settings ingame as well (https://forums.factorio.com/5048).
    - The number input box "consumes" only numeric input. Other keys for walking or closing the window still work when the field is selected.
      This is true as long as these are not mapped to numbers, bad luck in that case (https://forums.factorio.com/5741)
    - Fixed that actions made in the last tick before closing the scenario due to error were applied again when different game was opened. (https://forums.factorio.com/5741).
  Debugging:
    - Added option to turn off vertical synchronisation of the display (v-sync).
    - Fixed crash when starting game without config file.
  Gui:
    - Progress bar showing electricity availability is now colored. Green for all required energy available, yellow, more than half, red less than half.
  Modding:
    - Progress bar style enables to specify different colors for different ranges of values.
  Scripting:
    - Added game.get_chunks() iterator and game.is_chunk_generated(...) and game.player.force.is_chunk_charted() methods.
    - Pre player mined item event is called really before the player starts to get items from the inventory.
      Note that the change means, that the event is called even when the mine can eventually fail
      (not enough inventory to hold all the items). In the future, we might add an event for when the entity is really going to be removed.

    - Using map2scenario no longer resets researched technologies and unlocked recipes.
    - Migrations are applied even when using map2scenario.
    - Fixed bug when blueprints were "looting" the items from transport belt to grounds (https://forums.factorio.com/5587).

      roboport in the trunk. Saves corrupted this way from earlier versions are not loadable.
  Changes:
    - Changed the prioritization of resupplying source of logistic robots.
      provider has biggest priority, then storage and the last one is passive provider.
      This is to avoid uncontrolled filling of storage chests from the leftovers.

  Features:
    - Blueprints. Blueprint item allows the player to select the area that will be copied into the item.
      The player can customise the icons that will represent the blueprint.
      While building blueprints, player can rotate these, and they can also overlap with existing entities as long as they match.
    - Deconstruction tool. Allows player to order construction robots to deconstruct buildings in the selected area.
      When the buildings contain items (chests, transport belts etc.) construction robots first move these items out of it and place it
      into the logistics network.
    - Oil industry.
      Pumpjacks mine the crude oil from the oil spills.
      Oil refinery processes the crude oil to oil fractions.
      Chemical plant processes the oil fractions to useful products.
    - Added fluid storage tank.
    - Added electric onshore pump (can speed up the fluid or push the fluid against the slope).
    - Biomes. Gives more variation to the nature, tends to generate similar types of vegetation close together.
    - Logistic network condition for smart inserters. Takes the sum of all items in storage/provider chests into consideration.
    - Recipe gui contains even recipes not craftable by player (their tooltip shows machines where they can be crafted).
    - Copying entity settings (replaces the old shift build functionality).
      Shift + left click sets the selected entity as a copy source, shift + right click applies the settings to selected entity.
    - Ghost buildings can be built (shift + right click) and mined individually.
    - Saves directory can contain custom sub directories. Added delete save button.
    - Game saves and mods are read / written natively to the zip files.
    - CTRL in the textfields including dev console (CTRL + left/right = jump word, CTRL + backspace = delete word, CTRL + up/down = home/end).
    - Roboports have separate logistic radius (now 25) and construction radius (now 50).
    - Player gets separate warning icon when building is destroyed.
    - Warning icons tooltip shows list of entities that are under attack/destroyed/attacking.
    - Highlight inventory slots that contains results of the recipe the player already have when he is hovering the recipe slot.
    - Added / updated sounds for player actions (building, mining buildings, crafting, inventory move, gui click, etc.)
    - Optional ordering of items sub-categories into individual lines in the crafting window.
  Graphics:
    - New pipes graphics.
    - All not connected pipe connections have ending visualisation.

    - Optimisation of the logistic network update - slow performance with many robots with cargo and no place to put it.
    - Optimisation of the electric network update by the factor of 5.
    - Optimisation of inserters update, inserters that have nothing to do are set to sleep and woke up when their target/source changes.
    - Turrets don't search for enemies when there are no enemies nearby.
    - Logistic network doesn't go through empty provider chests/satisfied requester chests any more, so they don't slow down the update.
    - Only chunks with changes are recharted, so the limit of 2 recharted chunks per ticks is applied only on chunk that actually changed,
      this allows to have much higher areas covered by radars.
    - Optimisation of the building electric poles by dragging (It could get slow for big networks).
    - Small optimisation of transport belt movement.
  Balancing:
    - Changed many existing recipes (science pack 2, science pack 3, advanced circuit, laser turret, car, diesel locomotive,
        logistic and construction robots, rocket, flamethrower ammo, defender capsules, most of the armor equipment, etc.)
    - Nerfed down productivity modules. Best module productivity bonus changed: 15->10, it has slow down factor, and its usage
      in assembling machines is limited to intermediate products.
    - Slightly more stone in the world.
    - Pipe to ground is made in pairs and is more expensive.
    - Fast/Express transport belt to ground is made from Basic/Fast transport belt to ground + gears so it can be upgraded.

    - By default the left mouse key builds and opens gui and the right mouse key does mining.
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.5.0 version (You can use version up to 0.6.4 to load any old saves and re-save them).
    - MiningDrill can be built only if there are some resources within its radius.
    - The world is slowly generated around the player up to big distance, so exploring should not matter regarding
      the existance of enemies.
  Bugfixes:
    - Modules are now transfered when fast replacing furnaces.
    - Electricity icon of laser turrets in ghost mode.
    - Fixed missing black text font borders in some of the texts.
    - Fixed crash when opening gui in the ghost mode that is active in some of the challenge missions.
    - Fixed crash when player fed turret with ammo at the same moment it was destroyed.

Version: 0.7.0
Date: 27.9. 2013
  Features:
    - The factory now produces pollution. Pollution is visible on the map after pressing ALT key.
      Pollution is mostly produced by mining drills, things that burn coal, assembling machines and modules.
    - Enemy creepers were replaced by small, medium and big biters.
    - Enemy turrets were replaced by small, medium and big shooting worms.
    - Enemy attacks are triggered by pollution accumulated around their base (no time based attacks from the script anymore).
    - Enemies move and attack in groups.
    - Enemies wander around their base when they have nothing to do.
    - Enemies call for help when attacked.
    - Enemies can create new bases.
    - Added new weapons / ammos: shotgun, combat shotgun, explosive rockets.
    - Added upgrades (research) for all types of ammo and for laser turrets as well.
    - Added concept of capsules (usable items). Capsules are used from quickbar.
      Quickbar shortcut (1-5 shift 1-5) applies the capsule at mouse position.
      Current capsules: basic grenade, poison cloud capsule (doesn't damage buildings),
                        slowdon capsule (doesn't work on buildings), combat robot capsules (spawns robot(s) that fight the enemies)
    - The player movement is slower when he is shooting (differs per weapon).
    - Added Modular armors with placeable equipment. The armor is opened by right clicking it.
      Equipments can be: night vision, speedup exoskeleton, energy sources, batteries, energy shields, laser defense, discharge defense
    - Weapons have different damage types, entities have different resistances.
    - Added production statistics similar to the electricity statistics. (on the P key by default)
    - "Shift-build" - when building with shift the settings of the last built entity of that type are applied.
      This works for assembling machine, smart/logistics chest and inserter, includes circuit network wiring and internal settings.
    - Laboratories and mining drills are module compatible.
    - Logistic robots try to not mix different items in storage chests if possible.
    - Placing resources now uses the "autoplace" mechanism as well (see lua data files).
    - Better labeling of map generation parameters (swapped frequency and size),
      frequency and size are less dependent on each other.
    - Automatic updates can use proxy server.
  Gui:
    - Extended tips and tricks.
    - Mark missing elemental ingredients in the recipe tooltip as red.
    - Show cooldown of weapons/usable items in the slot.
    - Debug settings can be changed in game (F4 triggers the gui).
    - Flying text notification when a train has no path.
    - Automatically connect rolling stocks into trains when placed nearby with indication.
    - Show direction of train stop when to be built/selected.
    - Show connected/to be connected rails that are selected/to be build
    - Double click in load/save dialog opens/saves the game.

    - Removed the filter inserter (merged with smart inserter), all filter inserters are transformed into smart inserters.
    - Land mine has bigger damage radius and trigger.
    - Disabled loading of saves before 0.3.0 version (You can use 0.6.4 to load any old saves and re-save them).
    - Enemies can destroy all player creations they find (not only labs, turrets, logistic robots, train and player as it was now)
    - Long hand inserter puts the item into the distance 2 (instead of 1).
    - Decreased the car health from 2000 to 500, laser from 350 to 250.
    - Increased the wall health bar from 200 to 350 and increased health of most of the player structures.
    - Enemy spawners and turrets slowly regenerate health.
    - Electric pole connects to all poles in the reach with no common neighbour. The limit of 5 connection per pole stays.
      Building electric poles with shift pressed builds it without any connections.
  BugFixes:
    - Straight belt pushes items from the center to one of the sides, so randomly inserted items on belt
      shouldn't cause stucks in the U turns.
    - Indestructible objects are now handled properly in the path finding.
    - Fix of game being very slow with lots of logistic robots with no place to put items (no free storage chests).
    - Fixed several critical bugs in the map editor.
    - Fixed of confused logistic system when rebuilding logistic chests
    - Shortened number format works properly for large negative numbers.
    - Fixed script crashes when using god mode in freeplay.

    - Player inventory didn't get autosorted when item was crafted or delivered by logistic robot.
    - Player crafting gui didn't get updated (number of items craftable), when player recieved
      items from logistic robots or dropped item on ground.
    - Fixed sharp edges in new maps.
    - Fixed crash when player hovers ammo placed in quickbar.
    - Fixed bug of losing bonus production in furnace/assembling machine when the output slot is full (the production will stop instead).
    - Item tooltip is updated when the item on selected slot changes and closed when the slot is cleared.
  Optimisations:
    - Mining drills deactivate when the resources run out.
    - Speedups in the path finding (though path finding around very big lakes is still slow).
    - Speedups in enemy movement.
  Scripting:
    - Fixed lua gui element#isvalid function, it threw error when the element was invalid.
    - Added lua object for entity/item prototype. All prototypes can be aquired by game.(entity/item)prototypes.
    - Added (readonly now) way to access tiles by game.get_tile(x.y) (provides name property and collides_with method)
    - getenergy method additionally works for Lamp, Lab, Electric turret, Accumulator, Car, Locomotive and Solar panel.
    - The on_chunk_generated event is now called for all chunks, even for the starting area and for chunks created in map editor.
  Modding:
    - Result of shooting, projectiles, capsules and items used in general, is now specified by our small but powerful effect framework.
    - Added way to migrate/rename entity/item prototypes.
    - Introduced moddable game wide map settings in data/base/prototypes/map-settings.lua.

    - The game doesn't crash when unlock recipe modifier is used in market, although, the
      gui interface should be upgraded. (Price is not shown in the tooltip, and is not understandable
      that you are not buying the item, but the recipe. There is no indication, when you already
      have the recipe, this will be added as feature later, this is bugfix release.)

    - Updated recipe tooltip for assembling machine output and technology window.
    - Inserter can pick up to 5 items when moving from inventory to inventory (when researched), this is
      useful for faster loading/unloading of cargo in train stations.

    - Configurable car trunk size in the entity definition.
    - Measure time spent in scripts divided in individual mods and show in time statistics info (F5).

      research and enabled state of technologies, so it is usable in migrations to reload existing technologies that changed.
    - Enabled to have recipe with no prerequisities (just energy). In the crafting gui, it shows Inifnite count craftable
      of that item (and all items dependent on recipes that are for free).

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 29.3. 2013
  Features:
    - Game updates are using timer event. The program keeps 60 game updates even with FPS < 60 or FPS > 60.
      The "catchup rate" is configurable. When the FPS drops very low this stops having the effect.
    - Added walls. (Walls are made from stone bricks, these are created from stone in the furnace.)
    - Storing console history in the player data.
  Graphics:
    - New tree graphics (8 dry trees  12  big trees)
    - New inserter graphics
    - New laser turret and gun turret graphics
    - Bullet particles for gun turret
    - New solar panel graphics
    - Lighter stone furnace graphics
    - New logistic robot graphics
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when restarting the game with technology gui opened.
    - Fixed crafting queue properties when saved during crafting.
    - Fixed laser turret not consuming energy in idle state.
    - Splitter has maximum memory of 5 items when forced to send items on one side because the other one is blocked.
      This means that when left is block for a long time, and then both are free, the right will get mostly 5 items
      before it is splitted 1:1 again.
    - Fixed that the electric pole has the same orientation all the time (regardless connections)
  Gui:
    - Removed the text length limit from the input console.
    - Wrapping of the console text in the game.
  Modding:
    - Mods are self sustainable folders now. They contain the prototype definitions, graphics, sounds, locale, scenarios or campaigns.
    - Mods Gui in the game to enable / disable mods and change their ordering.
    - The default game contents is treated as a mod (called base).
    - Prototype definitions are generated by Lua scripts (no json anymore). Mods can manipulate the definitions from previous mods.
    - Mods can have control.lua script that supplements / changes the behavior of the default scenario script.
    - Multiple running scripts (from the mods) can communicate with each other using interfaces.
    - General furnace energy source specification in json (so it can be electric)
    - Started to use the name of the recipe, this allows different recipes for the same product.
      Having different recipes for the same product for player crafting is not tested (regarding the auto crafting)
    - Translation files are merged properly.
    - Default english fallback for translations.
  Scripting:
    - Simple way to add gui elements using script.
    - Divided the player and its character, some functions that are not directly connected with the charater (goal description, printing etc)
      are accessible from the player object, the rest from the charater.
      The access to character is game.player.character
    - The migration script runs before the control.lua is loaded and can be used to reload scripts from the original scenario
      this is used to solve the issue of incompatibile scripts in the save game.
    - Merged onunitdied and onplayerdied to on_entity_died
    - Check for positive addition in the LuaInventory::insert method
    - Added LuaInventory::remove method
    - Added LuaInventory::get_contents method
    - Simplier access to player from game object (game.player instead of game.get_player())
    - Added LuaRecipe::reload method
    - Added force parameter in create_entity so player can specify the owner of the created entity (was always enemy now)
    - Added way to change force of entity and damage entity (damaging is different then sethealth).
    - Position doesn't need to be in format {x = 34, y = 7}, the format {34 ,7} works as well, the
      same with bounding box.
    - Added simple interface for the Freeplay that allows manipulating the attacks from mod scripts.
    - Scripts receive only events they have subscribed to.
    - Scripts can emit their own events (for instance Freeplay emits an event whenever it starts the attack).

      b) It is possible to run console commands in these games.
    - Tool tip in tecnology preview shows total raw in the same system as in player crafting gui
      (Using just recipes that player can use for the calculations, so not smelting)

      where count of mining drills/furnaces was done manually
    - In Lua set_multi_command now returns number of units sent
    - Moved functions getrecipes and gettechnologies from the LuaEntity to LuaForce.
  Modding:
    - Recipe categories (Both crafting and furnace recipes merged into one list, recipes are categorised now)
    - Current recipe categories are "crafting" + "smelting", it is now possible to add new recipe
      categories in the prototype-definitions/recipe-category folder.
    - Player/Assembling machine/Furnace prototype contains list of recipe categories they can use, this
      should make it easier to make specialised machines.
