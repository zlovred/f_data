think-simple-setup=I have the electricity test setup almost ready. I just need some water from the lake.
goal-build-pump=Build an offshore pump on a water/ground transition.
goal-connect-boiler-to-water=Build pipes to get the water from the offshore pump into the boilers.
goal-fuel-into-boiler=Make sure the water flowing into the steam engine is hot enough.
goal-build-steam-engine=Build a steam engine connected to the boiler.
msg-cold-water=The water is flowing into the steam engine but it is too cold to produce any electricity.
msg-electricity-setup=Good, the steam engine is now producing the electricity.
msg-steam-engine-introduction-1=There are more ways to build steam engines. Like this:
msg-steam-engine-introduction-2=Or this:
msg-steam-engine-effectivity=The steam engine's efficiency is highest when it gets water at 100 degrees.
goal-build-electric-mining-drill=Build an electric mining drill over some resources.
goal-power-electric-mining-drill=Connect the electric mining drill to the steam engine using small electric poles.
think-piece-of-cake=Alright, it is all working. That was a piece of cake.
msg-factory-instruction-1=In order to build radars you will need to gather some iron plates and copper plates first.
msg-factory-instruction-2=Use electric mining drill to mine the resources. It is much faster than the burner mining drill.

msg-ship-wreck-located=Small shipwreck located to the southeast.
think-explore-ship-wreck=Alright, it's time to explore that area.
msg-need-better-weapon=This pistol won't be enough to hold them. I should make a submachine gun.

msg-need-light=It's getting dark, I should build some lamps.
epilogue=Congratulations, you have finished the demo campaign!  \n\nThe current alpha version of the game contains much more content than the demo. The alpha already provided many of our users with hundreds of hours of challenge and fun when building their factories. There are crafting machines, research to unlock new recipes, trains for larger scale logistics, signals for advanced automated setups, smart flying logistic robots and much more. You can also make your own maps or try out some of the existing mods in the alpha. \n\nThe game is still in progress and people who buy the alpha support the ongoing development. In case you liked the demo, we will be grateful if you purchase the alpha version at Factorio.com/order.\n Thank you.
epilogue-no-demo=Congratulations, you have finished the tutorial/demo campaign!\n\nAs you have the full game, you can either continue by playing the New Hope campaign, or jump into the freeplay. Either way, it is advised to go through the tips and tricks.\nWe wish you have fun with Factorio and thank you for your support.
msg-active-gun=You can equip several weapons. The active one is marked with a green background.
msg-change-active-gun=You can change active weapons by pressing __CONTROL__next-weapon__ (the weapon to change to must have ammo).
