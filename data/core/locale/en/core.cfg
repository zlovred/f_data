[tips-and-tricks]
other-furnace-usage-title=Other products made in furnace
other-furnace-usage-text=A furnace can smelt stone bricks from raw stone and steel from iron plate (the steel recipe needs to be researched).
two-sides-of-belts-title=Two sides of belts
two-sides-of-belts-text=The left and right side of the transport belt can be used independently for different resources. Inserters put things on the distant part of the belt, and can take items from either side.
rebuilding-title=Rebuilding
rebuilding-text=Stone furnaces can be rebuilt with steel furnaces without the need to mine them first, this is called fast-replacing. This also works for assembling machines, transport belts, inserters, chests and similar. It can be used to change direction of transport belt.
electric-network-info-title=Electric network info
electric-network-info-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__open-gui__" on electric pole will open statistics of the electric network it is connected to.
stack-transfer-title=Stack transfer
stack-transfer-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__stack-transfer__" will move the whole item stack. Moreover, the transfer command is smart enough to figure out where to move the stack. For instance, performing a stack transfer on an __ITEM__iron-axe__ in the main inventory will have it placed into the tools slot.
inventory-transfer-title=Inventory transfer
inventory-transfer-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__inventory-transfer__" will move all the item stacks of given type between inventories. This can be used, for instance, to transfer all the transport belts from the __ENTITY__wooden-chest__ to the main inventory.
fast-entity-transfer-title=Fast Entity transfer
fast-entity-transfer-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer__" allows you to perform a transfer with the selected entity without opening its gui. If the player's hand is empty the transfer happens from the entity into the player's inventory, and vice-versa when player's hand is full. This can be useful in the early stages of the game, in order to manage __ENTITY__stone-furnace__s, __ENTITY__burner-mining-drill__s, etc.
quickbar-title=Quickbar access
quickbar-text=Every quickbar slot has a shortcut to fetch the item into the cursor. If you already have another item from the quickbar in the cursor, it is returned to the slot it was taken from.

clean-cursor-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__clean-cursor__" will move the item stack from the cursor into your inventory/quickbar.
show-info-title=Additional info
show-info-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__show-info__" will toggle the extended info overlay.
building-while-running-title=Building while running
building-while-running-text=The quickest way to build more stuff in a straight line, like transport belts, pipes or inserters is to hold the "__CONTROL__build__" on the place you want them to be built and run in the desired direction.
building-electric-lines-title=Fast building of electric lines
building-electric-lines-text=The fast way to build electric line is to drag the build key while moving, the next pole will be built on the furthest possible place automatically.
filter-title=Filters
filter-text=Pressing "__CONTROL__toggle-filter__" on the quickbar slot lets you set what this slot is reserved for. No other item can be placed into this slot, and items of the selected type will be moved into this slot.
copy-paste-title=Copy & paste
copy-paste-text=Using "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings__" an entity is selected as a copy source. Its settings can then be pasted to a different entity using "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings__". Copying from assembling machine to requester chests sets it to request the ingredients needed for the recipe, copying between train stops sets the name of the target identical to the name of the source. Copy & paste can be also used on locomotives to duplicate train schedules.
requester-chest-paste-title = Copy-pasting to requester chests
requester-chest-paste-text=Pasting a recipe using "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings__" from an assembling machine to a requester chest, will set the logistic request to the ingredients for that recipe. For most recipes the requested amount is double the count of required ingredients.
blueprint-book-scrolling-title = Switching blueprints within the blueprint book
blueprint-book-scrolling-text = When you are holding the blueprint book, you can move through the inventory of stored blueprints by using "__CONTROL__cycle-blueprint-forwards__" and "__CONTROL__cycle-blueprint-backwards__".
copy-paste-wagon-slots-title = Copying wagon slot filters
copy-paste-wagon-slots-text = You can copy the wagon slot filter between inventory slots in the same way as copy-pasting between entities, using "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings__" to copy a slot filter and "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings__" to paste it to the selected slot.
